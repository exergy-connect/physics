# Exergy Naming

> **An open-source exploration engine by Exergy LLC. Mapping ontologies as dynamic landscapes to navigate the adjacent possible and shape the next frontier of structure.**

---

## 🔭 The Philosophy

Traditional ontology tools treat data as a static archive—a rigid library of what is already known. **Exergy Naming** shifts the perspective.

In thermodynamics, **Exergy** is the energy available to be used. We apply this principle to information: we view ontologies as active systems of potential. By leveraging the concept of the **Adjacent Possible**, this browser maps not only the existing nodes of a naming system but also the latent connections and "next-step" innovations that sit just beyond the current boundary.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Landscape Mapping**: Move away from flat lists and rigid trees. View your ontology as a navigable, evolving terrain.
* **The Adjacent Possible**: Visualization layers that highlight the "nearest neighbor" potential for expansion and naming.
* **Standard Web Integration**: A zero-install, browser-native experience built on modern web standards.
* **Structure Shaping**: Tools designed not just to observe, but to propose and define the next frontier of your conceptual framework.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since this is a standard web-based engine, you simply need a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

Start: https://exergy-connect.github.io/naming/

## 🗺️ How it Works

1. **Ingest**: Load your conceptual models (JSON, Custom Schema, or API streams).
2. **Analyze**: The engine calculates the "Exergy" of current nodes—their connectivity and descriptive power.
3. **Explore**: Navigate the "Actual" landscape while the engine renders the "Adjacent Possible" in the periphery.
4. **Shape**: Commit new nodes to the structure to expand the boundary of your project.

## 🤝 Contributing

We believe that the next frontier of structure is best built together. As an open-source project, we welcome contributions that:

* Enhance the visualization of conceptual landscapes.
* Refine the algorithms used to identify the adjacent possible.
* Improve the performance of the engine within standard web environments.
