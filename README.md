# Exergy Physics

> **An interactive browser for exploring humanity's collective understanding of physics. Navigate through physics theories and concepts organized chronologically and visually mapped by their historical development.**

---

## 🔭 The Philosophy

**Exergy Physics** presents physics knowledge as a navigable tree structure, where each concept is colored according to when it was developed—from the oldest theories (redshifted) to the most recent (blueshifted). This visualization reflects how our understanding of physics has evolved over time, creating a cosmic map of human knowledge.

## 🚀 Features

* **Chronological Color Mapping**: Physics concepts are visualized using a redshift-to-blueshift color scheme, where older theories appear redder and newer ones appear more violet/blue, spanning from 1637 to today.
* **Hierarchical Organization**: Browse physics knowledge organized by major categories: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Physics, Relativity, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, and Particle Physics.
* **Interactive Exploration**: Click on any concept to view detailed summaries and access Wikipedia articles for deeper learning.
* **Smart Search**: Quickly find specific physics theories and concepts using the built-in search functionality.
* **Year-Based Sorting**: Each hierarchy level is automatically sorted by year, showing the chronological development of physics concepts.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since this is a standard web-based application, all you need is a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge): https://exergy-connect.github.io/physics/

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start exploring physics concepts!

The application uses:
- `index.html` - Main application interface
- `data.js` - Physics knowledge base with theories, years, and summaries

## 🗺️ How it Works

1. **Browse**: Navigate through the hierarchical tree structure of physics concepts
2. **Explore**: Click on parent nodes to expand and see their children
3. **Learn**: Click on leaf nodes (individual concepts) to view summaries and access Wikipedia
4. **Search**: Use the search bar to quickly find specific theories or concepts
5. **Visualize**: Observe the color gradient that represents the chronological development of physics knowledge

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand and improve this physics knowledge browser:

* Add more physics concepts and theories to the knowledge base
* Improve summaries and descriptions of existing concepts
* Enhance the visualization and user interface
* Add new features for exploring physics knowledge

To contribute:
1. Add or update entries in `data.js` following the existing structure
2. Each concept should include: `name`, `year`, and optionally `summary`
3. Ensure proper hierarchical organization within the existing categories
