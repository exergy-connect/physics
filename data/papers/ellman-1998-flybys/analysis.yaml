# This file contains entities created during the analysis of Ellman's 1998 paper analyzing
# the Earth flyby anomaly. This paper connects the Earth flyby anomaly to the Pioneer anomaly,
# proposing that both share the same cause - a centrally directed, distance-independent
# acceleration. Ellman further proposes that this acceleration is caused by a universal decay
# of the length dimension of all material reality, which would also explain galactic rotation
# curves without requiring dark matter.

    description: |
      Unaccounted for changes in spacecraft speed, both increases and decreases, observed during
      Earth flybys of six different spacecraft from December 8, 1990 to August 2, 2005. The anomaly
      appears as a small, centrally directed, distance-independent acceleration toward Earth, similar
      to the Pioneer anomaly. All potential sources of systematic error have been modeled and cannot
      account for the observed anomalies.

assumption:
  - assumption_id: "flyby-assumption-central-acceleration"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The Earth flyby anomaly is caused by a small acceleration (in addition to natural gravitation), centrally directed and independent of distance, directed toward the core center of Earth"
    rationale: "Ellman proposes that the flyby anomaly shares the same characteristics as the Pioneer anomaly - a centrally directed, distance-independent acceleration"

  - assumption_id: "flyby-assumption-shared-cause"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The Flyby Anomaly and Pioneer Anomaly share the same cause - a centrally directed, distance-independent acceleration"
    rationale: "Ellman argues that both anomalies exhibit the same characteristics and thus likely have the same underlying cause"

  - assumption_id: "flyby-assumption-universal-decay"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "A universal decay of the length dimension of all material reality causes the anomalous accelerations observed in flybys, Pioneer spacecraft, and galactic rotation curves"
    rationale: "Ellman proposes that a universal length decay would produce centrally directed, distance-independent accelerations without conflicting with planetary ephemeris"

claim:

    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Six different spacecraft involved in Earth flybys from December 8, 1990 to August 2, 2005 showed unaccounted for changes in spacecraft speed, both increases and decreases"

  - claim_id: "flyby-claim-latitude-effect"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The magnitude of the anomalous acceleration component parallel to the spacecraft flight path depends on latitude, with the effective acceleration being A(λ) = A·Cos[λ], where λ is the latitude"
    status: "theoretical"

  - claim_id: "flyby-claim-net-effect"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Depending on the specific flight path, a spacecraft may experience overall net anomalous acceleration or deceleration, or zero net modification if the path is perfectly symmetrical relative to the equator"
    status: "theoretical"

  - claim_id: "flyby-claim-cosmic-connection"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The same anomalous centrally directed, distance-independent acceleration occurs relative to Earth (flyby anomaly), relative to the Sun (Pioneer anomaly), in galactic rotation curves, and in rotating groups of galaxies"
    status: "theoretical"

  - claim_id: "flyby-claim-no-ephemeris-conflict"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "A universal decay of the length dimension would not conflict with the planetary ephemeris and would not be detectable except in unusual circumstances like the Pioneer and Flyby anomalies"
    status: "theoretical"
