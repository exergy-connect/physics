#
# This file contains entities created during the analysis of Shamir's 2024 paper documenting
# an empirical observation of redshift bias based on galaxy rotation direction relative to
# the Milky Way. The paper shows that galaxies rotating in the same direction as the Milky Way
# have systematically higher redshifts than those rotating in the opposite direction, with the
# bias increasing at higher redshifts. This observation is consistent across multiple datasets
# (SDSS, DESI, HSC DR3) and may provide the first direct empirical evidence for Zwicky's
# tired-light theory, potentially explaining the H0 tension and mature galaxies at high redshifts.

    summary: |
      Theory proposed by Fritz Zwicky that photons lose energy as they travel through space,
      causing redshift without requiring expansion. In extreme form, argues the Big Bang is
      an artifact and the Universe is in steady state. The theory has lacked direct empirical
      evidence until potentially this observation.

    summary: |
      The standard model of cosmology based on dark energy (Lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM).
      Assumes redshift is primarily due to cosmic expansion and Hubble flow. Faces tensions
      including H0 tension and unexpected mature galaxies at high redshifts observed by JWST.

assumption:
  - assumption_id: "redshift-assumption-rotational-velocity-negligible"
    theory_id: "standard-cosmological-model"
    statement: "The rotational velocity of the Milky Way galaxy relative to observed galaxies has a negligible effect on redshift measurements"
    rationale: "Standard redshift models assume rotational velocity is far smaller than linear velocity and can be ignored when measuring cosmological redshift"

    theory_id: "standard-cosmological-model"
    statement: "Redshift corresponds primarily to the linear velocity of objects relative to Earth due to cosmic expansion"
    rationale: "Standard cosmological model interprets redshift as Doppler effect from Hubble flow and cosmic expansion"
