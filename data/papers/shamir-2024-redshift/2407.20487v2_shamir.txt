Abstract

existence of massive galaxies at high redshifts was reported
also before JWST was launched (Neeleman et al., 2020), and
JWST provided more and deeper instances of such galaxies,
showing that mature galaxies were prevalent in the early Universe. Another example of a puzzling unexplained observation
is the H0 tension, reflected by two different messengers that
provide two different expansion rates and ages of the Universe
(Wu and Huterer, 2017; Mörtsell and Dhawan, 2018; Bolejko,
2018; Davis et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2020; Camarena and
Marra, 2020; Di Valentino et al., 2021; Riess et al., 2022).
Since both measure the same Universe, it can be assumed
that one of these measurements is biased.
These puzzling observations introduce a challenge to cosmology: If the distance indicators are fully accurate, the standard cosmological theories are incomplete. If the current standard cosmological theories are complete, then the distance indicators might not be fully accurate. That is, either the standard cosmological theories need to be revised, or the redshift
as a distance indicator needs to be revised, but the two might
not be able to co-exist without modifications. While some
solutions include alternative cosmological models, it has also
been suggested that the tensions can be solved by changing
the redshift model (Crawford, 1999; Pletcher, 2023; Gupta,
2023; Lee, 2023; Lovyagin et al., 2022).
The redshift of an astronomical object is expected to correspond to the linear velocity of the object relative to Earth.
But in addition to the linear velocity, the measurement of the
redshift can also be affected by the rotational velocity of the
observed galaxy, or the rotational velocity of the Milky Way.
The rotational velocity of a luminous object can affect the
Doppler shift effect (Marrucci, 2013; Lavery et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2019), but since the rotational velocity of a galaxy is far
smaller than its linear velocity, it is assumed that the effect
of the rotational velocity is negligible. For that reason the
rotational velocity of galaxies is ignored in common redshift
models. However, it should be reminded that the physics of
galaxy rotation, and namely its rotational velocity, is still one
of the most mysterious and most provocative phenomena in
nature.
While the puzzling nature of the physics of galaxy rotation
was noted in the first half of the 20th century (Oort, 1940),
only five decades later it became part of the mainstream science (Rubin, 1983; El-Neaj et al., 2020). Common explanations include dark matter (Rubin, 1983) or modified Newtonian dynamics (Milgrom, 1983), but numerous other explanations have also been proposed (Sanders, 1990; Capozziello

Recent advancements have shown tensions between observations and our current understanding of the Universe. Such observations may include the Ho tension and massive galaxies at
high redshifts that are older than what traditional galaxy formation models predicted. Since these observations are based
on the redshift as the primary distance indicator, a bias in
the redshift may explain these tensions. While the redshift
follows an established model, when applied to astronomy it
is based on the assumption that the rotational velocity of the
Milky Way galaxy relative to the observed galaxies has a negligible effect on the redshift. But given the mysterious nature
of the physics of galaxy rotation, that assumption should be
tested. The test is done by comparing the redshift of galaxies
rotating in the same direction relative to the Milky Way to the
redshift of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative
to the Milky Way. The results show that the mean redshift of
galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky
Way is higher than the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate
in the opposite direction. Additionally, the redshift difference
becomes larger as the redshift gets higher. The consistency of
the analysis was verified by comparing data collected by three
different telescopes, annotated using four different methods,
released by three different research teams, and cover both
the Northern and Southern ends of the galactic pole. All
datasets are in excellent agreement with each other, showing
consistency in the observed redshift bias. Given the “reproducibility crisis” in science, all datasets used in this study are
publicly available, and the results can be easily reproduced.
The observation could be a first direct empirical reproducible
observation for the Zwicky’s “tired-light” model.

Introduction

he unprecedented imaging power of JWST has revealed new
information about the Universe that is not aligned with some
of the current fundamental cosmological assumptions. For
instance, the presence of galaxies at redshifts higher than 13
(Curtis-Lake et al., 2023) or even as high as 15 (Whitler et al.,
2023) was not expected according to previous assumptions
(Cowley et al., 2018). Mature massive galaxies observed at
redshift of ∼11 (Glazebrook et al., 2024) also challenge the
cosmological model and the history of the Universe. The

Rivera, 2020; Nagao, 2020; Blake, 2021; Gomel and Zimmerman, 2021; Skordis and Zlośnik, 2021; Larin, 2022). But despite over a century of scientific research, there is still no
proven explanation to the nature of galaxy rotation (Sanders,
1990; Mannheim, 2006; Kroupa, 2012; Kroupa et al., 2012;
Kroupa, 2015; Arun et al., 2017; Akerib et al., 2017; Bertone

Sivaram et al., 2020; Hofmeister and Criss, 2020; Byrd and
Howard, 2021; Haslbauer et al., 2022a,b).
The purpose of this experiment is to examine the impact
of the galaxy rotational velocity on the redshift. That can be
done by observing galaxies located around the Galactic pole,
and comparing the redshift of galaxies that rotate in the same
direction relative to the Milky Way to the redshift of galaxies
that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way.
An observed difference in the redshift can indicate that the
redshift is affected by the rotational velocity, and therefore
the way it is implemented in astronomy is incomplete.

galaxies that rotate in opposite direction relative to the Milky
Way. With the exception of the small Galaxy Zoo catalog,
in all cases the difference is statistically significant. The
observed ∆z difference was higher when using the smaller
10o × 10o field centered at the Galactic pole compared to
the larger 20o × 20o field. That can be explained by the difference in the relative rotational velocity that is expected to
increase when the observed galaxies are closer to the Galactic
pole. The SpArcFiRe algorithm was used with both the original images and with the mirrored images. That was done due
to the reported bias of the SpArcFiRe method (Hayes et al.,
2017). SpArcFiRe provided a higher number of galaxies, but
on the expense of the accuracy of the annotation, leading
to a smaller absolute ∆z though stronger statistical signal
due to the higher number of galaxies (Shamir, 2024b). The
Ganalyzer algorithm has a simple “mechanical” symmetric
nature (Shamir, 2011a, 2021, 2022a), and therefore mirroring the galaxies did not change the results (Shamir, 2024b).
When using SpArcFiRe the results changed when the galaxy
images were mirrored, but the change was not substantial,
except for the expected inverse ∆z observed when the galaxy
images were mirrored.

Analysis of HSC DR3 galaxies

The analysis shown in Section 2 and in (Shamir, 2024b) shows
a consistent but relatively small redshift bias. But these analyses are based on galaxies imaged mostly by SDSS, with one
experiment with galaxies obtained through DESI Legacy Survey. Therefore, most galaxies used for the experiments included in Table 1 are of relatively low redshift. That makes it
difficult to profile the change in ∆z when the redshift changes.
That is, if ∆z increases at higher redshift, it can provide an
indication that the redshift bias is higher for high-redshift
galaxies.
To profile the dependence between the ∆z and the redshift, an experiment was performed with the third data release (DR3) of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). Using the
8.2m Subaru telescope, HSC provides high details of galaxies
with higher redshifts compared to galaxies imaged by SDSS
or DESI Legacy Surveys. That allows to annotate galaxies
with higher redshift by their direction of rotation, and test
whether the redshift bias increases with the redshift.
The galaxies used in the experiment include all HSC DR3
galaxies that have redshifts in SDSS DR17. That included
101,415 galaxies with redshift of z < 0.3. The purpose of the
redshift limit was to avoid galaxies that cannot be annotated
accurately by their visible spin patterns. The galaxies were
annotated by the Ganalyzer algorithm (Shamir, 2011a,b) as
described in (Shamir, 2024b). That led to a clean dataset of
13,477 galaxies.
The smaller dataset of annotated galaxies compared to the
initial dataset is expected since not all galaxies are spiral, and
not all spiral galaxies have an identifiable direction of rotation.
Manual inspection of randomly selected 100 galaxies showed
that all galaxies are annotated accurately. The dataset can be
accessed at https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~lshamir/data/
zdifference_hsc/. The redshift distribution of the galax-

Figure 1: Distribution of the reshift of the HSC DR3 galaxies.
While providing better image quality and depth compared
to the catalogs summarized in Section 2, the downside of the
HSC catalog used here is that it does not cover neither the
South nor North end of the Galactic pole. Therefore, the
galaxies used for the analysis are galaxies that are closer to
the South end of the Galactic pole, as well as galaxies that are
close to the North end of the Galactic pole. The declination
of the galaxies range between −6.58o to 53.18o . The distribution of the right ascension is shown in Figure 2. The catalog
contains 4,724 galaxies that are within 60o from the Southern
Galactic pole, and 8,753 galaxies that are within 60o from the
Northern Galactic pole.
Tables 3 and 4 show the mean redshift of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way and in the
opposite direction relative to the Milky Way in the Southern
and Northern Galactic poles, respectively. The tables show
the difference between the mean z among all galaxies, but
also the differences when the galaxy population is separated
into 0.1 redshift ranges. As the table shows, in both ends of
the Galactic pole there is a statistically significant difference
between the redfshift of galaxies that rotate in the same direction as the Galactic pole, and galaxies that rotate in the
opposite direction relative to the Galactic pole.
The direction of rotation of the galaxies observed in the
opposite sides of the Galactic pole are inverse, such that a
galaxy located around the North end of the Galactic pole and
rotates in the same direction relative to the Milky Way would

seem to rotate in the opposite direction if it was located in
the South end of the Galactic pole. That is naturally taken
into account in the analysis, but the consistency between both
ends of the Galactic pole shows that the differences are not
driven by an unknown bias in the annotation, as such bias
should have been consistent in both ends of the Galactic pole,
and not expected to flip based on the locations of the galaxies
in the sky.

Verification using a third-party
dataset

To further test the consistency of the bias, the observation described in Sections 2 and 3 was compared to a third
party catalog (Longo, 2011). That catalog was prepared by
five undergraduate students who manually annotated SDSS
galaxies, and the galaxy images were also mirrored to offset for a possible human bias (Longo, 2011). While the
purpose of that dataset was not to compare redshifts or
test the impact of the rotational velocity of the Milky Way,
14,462 of the galaxies in that dataset has redshift, and
therefore can be used for the analysis. The dataset can
be accessed at https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/
1-s2.0-S0370269311003947-mmc1.txt. The redshift of all
galaxies that have spectra is smaller than 0.1, and the redshift distribution is displayed by Figure 4. The distribution
of the RA is displayed in Figure 5. As the figure shows, the
majority of the galaxies are in relatively close proximity to
the Northern Galactic pole.

As discussed in Section 2, the p-values are based on Student
t-test, and therefore on the the assumption that the redshifts
are distributed normally. Since that assumption might not
necessarily be correct, a simulation was performed such that
the galaxies were separated into two groups randomly, and
the mean redshift of one group was compared to the mean
redshift of the galaxies of the other group (Shamir, 2024b).
After 100,000 tests, the galaxies close to the Southern Galactic pole were separated into two random groups with mean
redshift difference larger than 0.00363 in 518 runs. The same
experiment when using the galaxies closer to the Northern
Galactic pole showed a mean redshift difference larger than
0.002451 in 230 of the runs. These simulation experiments
show that the probability to have such separation by mere
chance is far below 1%.
The simple separation of the analysis into several redshift
ranges shows that ∆z increases as the redshift gets higher.
That observation is consistent in both ends of the Galactic
pole. Figure 3 shows the ∆z in the different redshift ranges.
The statistical significance of the increase in ∆z can also
be determined by using a simple Pearson correlation after assigning the galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative
to the the Milky Way with the value 1, and galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as
-1. When using galaxies closer to the Northern Galactic pole
the Pearson correlation is 0.0296, and the probability to have
such correlation by chance is p=0.02. When using galaxies
closer to the Southern Galactic pole, the Pearson correlation
is 0.02669, and the p is 0.0064.

around the Northern Galactic pole, the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the direction of rotation and the redshift is
0.02033, and the probability to have this coefficient by chance
is ∼0.01. That provides an indication that the bias increases
with the redshift, as was also observed with the data from
HSC DR3. The third-party dataset therefore shows the same
observation as the dataset of HSC DR3 galaxies and in fact
data from all other premier sky surveys.

Possible link to Zwicky’s “tiredlight” model

The early Universe as imaged by JWST is different than the
early Universe predicted by the standard model. Among other
explanations, that tension was proposed to have a link to Fritz
Zwicky’s “tired-light” (TL) theory (Zwicky, 1929; Yourgrau
and Woodward, 1971; Vigier, 1977; Shao, 2013; Kragh, 2017;
Shao et al., 2018; Sato, 2019; LaViolette, 2021; Lovyagin et al.,
2022; Lopez-Corredoira, 2023; Gupta, 2023, 2024).
According to TL, photons lose their energy along their traveling path through the Universe. That can lead to differences
in the redshift as observed from Earth, and therefore different
galaxies that are more distant from Earth can have different
redshift than galaxies that are closer to Earth. If that theory
is correct, it can explain the early mature galaxies observed
by JWST, as their true age is not the same age that their
redshift indicates. In its extreme form, TL can argue that the
Big Bang is merely an artifact created by TL, and the Universe is in fact in steady state. One of the downsides of the
model is that there is no empirical observation that can show
that photons indeed lose their energy as they travel through
the Cosmos.
An empirical experiment that shows a redshift bias that
grows as the redshift gets higher is difficult to perform at
cosmological-scale distance, since the only information that
can be obtained is the redshift as observed from Earth. While
the distances of the galaxies can be estimated through other
candles such as Ia supernovae, it is difficult to prove whether
the redshift of a galaxy is higher because the galaxy indeed
moves faster away from Earth in accordance to the Big Bang
theory, because of TL, or a combination of the two. Ia supernovae are also limited in the distance range compared to
the redshift, and therefore a redshift bias in the very high

counterclockwise is 0.065±0.00029. The probability to have
such difference by chance is 0.018. While the statistically significant redshift difference might seem unexpected, most of
the galaxies are located near the Northern Galactic pole, and
therefore the lower redshift for galaxies that rotate counterclockwise is in agreement with the results shown in Table 4
using the HSC data taken from the Northern galactic pole, as
well as the other datasets show in Table 1. Table 5 shows the
mean z of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative
to the Milky Way in the catalog (Longo, 2011) and the mean
z of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to
the Milky Way in the Southern and Northern Galactic poles.

pole agrees well with the ∆z observed by HSC around the
Northern Galactic pole at the same redshift range of 0-0.1,
as shown in Table 4. The opposite end of the Galactic pole
also shows that galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction
relative to the Milky Way have lower redshift compared to
galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction, but in the case
of the (Longo, 2011) catalog the difference is not statistically
significant, possible due to the low number of galaxies in that
part of the sky.
Since the redshift of the galaxies in that catalog is limited
to z < 0.1, a direct comparison to the redshift ranges used
in Table 4 is not possible. However, when using the galaxies

redshifts will be difficult to profile using Ia supernovae.
But when using the rotational velocity of the Earth within
the Milky Way galaxy, a small redshift bias is expected due
to the rotational velocity of the Earth. That bias is expected
to affect galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to
the Milky Way differently than it affect galaxies that rotate
in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way. That bias
is expected to be small, but according to several datasets as
shown here it is statistically significant. More importantly,
the bias grows with the redshift, suggesting that it is not the
velocity alone that leads to the bias. The rotational velocity
of the Earth within the Milky Way galaxy is obviously a constant that does not change, and the radial velocity of galaxies
that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way
is expected to be, on average, the same as the radial velocity
of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to
the Milky Way. The idea that the redshift can change with
the distance, and not necessarily the velocity, might be an
indication supporting Fritz Zwicky’s century-old theory.
That observation can also be related to the far higher number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative
to the Milky Way as imaged by JWST (Shamir, 2024a). The
JWST deep field images show a 140% more galaxies that
rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way
(Shamir, 2024a). A possible explanation is that galaxies that
rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way
are brighter due to the Doppler shift effect. Due to TL, the
brightness difference gets more significant when the galaxies
are more distant from Earth, and therefore much more galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky
Way are observed. Earlier observation made before JWST
saw first light also showed such asymmetry that grows with
the redshift (Shamir, 2020, 2022b), although at the lower redshift ranged the asymmetry was far milder than the asymmetry observed in the early Universe image by JWST.

driven by the rotational velocity of the Milky Way relative to
the rotational velocity of the observed galaxies. The observed
bias is consistent across different telescopes, different annotation methods, and shows very similar bias in both ends of
the Galactic pole. It is also consistent in catalogs that were
collected for other purposes by different research teams.
The empirical observations described in this paper are provided with the data to ensure that the results can be reproduced. It had been shown that the vast majority of the scientific results cannot be reproduced (Stodden et al., 2018), introducing the challenge known as the “reproducibility crisis”
in science (Baker, 2016; Miyakawa, 2020; Sayre and Riegelman, 2018; Ball, 2023). The ability to access the data and
reproduce the results allows to advance science in a transparent manner, and avoid errors that might not be noticeable to
a reader unless they have access to the data.
In the current astrophysics and cosmology practices, the
redshift is used in most cases by ignoring the rotational velocity of the Milky Way, as the rotational velocity is far lower
than the linear velocity and can therefore be considered negligible. But it should be reminded that the physics of galaxy
rotation, and in particular the rotational velocity of galaxies, is still not fully understood (Opik, 1922; Babcock, 1939;
Oort, 1940; Rubin and Ford Jr, 1970; Rubin et al., 1978, 1980,
1985; Sanders, 1990; Sofue and Rubin, 2001; Mannheim, 2006;
Kroupa, 2012; Kroupa et al., 2012; Kroupa, 2015; Arun et al.,
2017; Akerib et al., 2017; Bertone and Tait, 2018; Aprile et al.,
2018; Skordis and Zlośnik, 2019; Sivaram et al., 2020; Hofmeister and Criss, 2020; Byrd and Howard, 2021; Gomel and Zimmerman, 2021; Haslbauer et al., 2022b). . Theories such as
dark matter (Rubin, 1983) or MOND (Milgrom, 1983) have
been proposed to explain the anomaly of the rotational velocity of galaxies, but several decades of research still have not
let to a proven explanation to the provocative nature of the
rotational velocity of galaxies.
It is difficult to identify an immediate explanation to the
link between the rotational velocity and the redshift as observed from Earth. A possible explanation is the tired-light
theory. But as mentioned above, the physics of galaxy rotation in general is difficult to explain without making unproven
assumptions. Since the redshift is the most common distance
indicator in cosmological scales, a bias in the redshift can impact a large number of other studies that make use of the
redshift.
Because the bias tends to becomes larger when the redshift
gets higher, it is possible that such bias can explain anomalies such as galaxies that according to the existing theories
are expected to be older than what traditional galaxy formation models predicted. The experiments described here were
based on relatively low redshift ranges, and therefore it is still
unclear whether higher redshifts will have significant redshift
bias. Studying the bias in higher redshifts will require to use a

Conclusion

Unexpected observations such as the H0 tension and galaxies
that according to the current theories are expected to be older
than what traditional galaxy formation models predicted are
challenging the standard cosmological model. If the cosmological model is complete and fully accurate, the distance measurements, and primarily the redshift, are biased. If the redshift is fully accurate then the standard cosmological model
and basic theories regarding galaxy formation and the history of the Universe are incomplete. In any case, the redshift
as used currently and the existing basic cosmological theories
cannot co-exist without modifications.
This paper presents empirical observations that show that
the redshift model might be biased, and the bias might be
6

large number of galaxies with redshift imaged by space-based
instruments such as JWST at around the galactic pole.
Because H0 is determined by using the redshift, a redshift
bias can also explain the observed H0 tension. For instance,
when using the SH0ES catalog (Khetan et al., 2021) of Ia
supernovae by just selecting the galaxies that rotate in the
same direction as the Milky Way, H0 drops from ∼73.7 to
∼69.05 km/sM pc−1 (McAdam and Shamir, 2023), which is
within statistical error from the H0 as observed by the CMB.
When using just SH0ES galaxies that rotate in the opposite
direction relative to the Milky Way, the H0 increases to ∼74.2
km/sM pc−1 (McAdam and Shamir, 2023). Although SH0ES
contains a relatively small number of Ia supernovae with their
host galaxies, it suggests that the redshift as a distance indicator might depend on the rotational velocity relative to the
rotational velocity of the Milky Way. This observation is also
aligned with the contention the H0 tension might require new
physics that applies to the entire Universe, rather than certain
changes in the physics of the early Universe (Vagnozzi, 2023).
Because the H0 is determined by using the redshift, redshift
bias can also be related to the observed H0 anisotropy (Javanmardi et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2022a; Cowell et al., 2022;
McConville and Colgain, 2023; Aluri et al., 2023), which is another puzzling observation that does not have an immediate
explanation.
It is also possible that the redshift difference is not a bias,
and galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to
the Milky Way are indeed closer to Earth compared to galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky
Way. In that case the alignment with both ends of the Galactic pole is merely a coincidence. Such large-scale alignment is
far larger than any known cluster, super-cluster, or filament
in the cosmic web. That might be in agreement with numerous other observations that suggest that the cosmological
principle is violated (Aluri et al., 2023).
Although alignment in galaxy spin directions is expected
(d’Assignies D et al., 2022; Kraljic et al., 2020), it does not
expect to form a cosmological-scale axis. If such axis indeed exists and it is not driven by the impact of the rotational velocity on the redshift measurements, it can be
linked with theories such as dipole cosmology (Ebrahimian
et al., 2023; Krishnan et al., 2022b; Allahyari et al., 2023;
Krishnan et al., 2023b,a), or rotating universe (Gödel, 1949;
Ozsváth and Schücking, 1962; Gödel, 2000; Chechin, 2016;
Campanelli, 2021). Theories that assume a universe rotating around a cosmological-scale axis include Black Hole Cosmology (Pathria, 1972; Stuckey, 1994; Easson and Brandenberger, 2001; Poplawski, 2010; Christillin, 2014; Dymnikova,
2019; Chakrabarty et al., 2020; Poplawski, 2021; Gaztanaga,
2022a,b) and ellipsoidal universe (Campanelli et al., 2006,
2007; Gruppuso, 2007; Campanelli et al., 2011; Cea, 2014).
Tensions between the expected age of some galaxies and
the age of the Universe, as well as other cosmological-scale
anisotropies and observations such as the Ho tension, challenge our understanding of the Universe. It is clear that the
current theories cannot co-exist with the reshift model as it is
used currently, and therefore if the current theories are complete, it means that the redshift as a distance indicator is
incomplete. This paper showed consistent evidence that the
redshift depends on the rotational velocity of the Milky Way

relative to the observed objects. The bias is small, but if
it increases in the redshift ranges of the JWST deep fields it
can potentially explain the existence of mature galaxies in the
early Universe.
