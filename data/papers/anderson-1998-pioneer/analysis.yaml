# This file contains entities created during the analysis of Anderson et al.'s 1998 paper
# documenting the Pioneer anomaly. This paper was the first detailed publication of the
# anomalous acceleration observed in Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft data. The paper documents
# an unexplained constant acceleration towards the Sun of approximately 8.5 × 10^-8 cm/s²,
# confirmed by two independent analysis codes. The anomaly challenged general relativity
# and led to extensive investigation, ultimately resolved in 2012 through thermal radiation
# analysis, though some residual unexplained acceleration may still exist.

assumption:
  - assumption_id: "pioneer-assumption-precise-tracking"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Pioneer spacecraft are excellent for dynamical astronomy studies because their spin-stabilization and great distances permit precise acceleration estimations to the level of 10^-10 cm/s² (averaged over 5 days)"
    rationale: "The paper states that Pioneer spacecraft require minimum Earth-attitude reorientation maneuvers, allowing precise measurement of small accelerations"

  - assumption_id: "pioneer-assumption-all-forces-accounted"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "All known forces acting on Pioneer spacecraft can be accurately modeled, including planetary perturbations, radiation pressure, interplanetary media, general relativity, and bias/drift in range and Doppler"
    rationale: "The paper states that analyses were modeled to include all these effects, suggesting they can be accounted for"

  - assumption_id: "pioneer-assumption-thermal-isotropic"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Thermal radiation from RTGs and spacecraft systems is approximately isotropic"
    rationale: "The paper states that if thermal radiation were not isotropic and caused the acceleration, it would have decreased with time, but no such decrease was observed after 1980"

claim:
  - claim_id: "pioneer-claim-anomalous-acceleration"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "There is an unmodelled acceleration towards the Sun of (8.09 ± 0.20) × 10^-8 cm/s² for Pioneer 10 and (8.56 ± 0.15) × 10^-8 cm/s² for Pioneer 11, confirmed by two independent analysis codes (JPL-ODP and CHASMP)"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1998

  - claim_id: "pioneer-claim-constant-acceleration"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The magnitude of the anomalous acceleration does not vary with distance, within a sensitivity of 2 × 10^-8 cm/s² over a range of 40 to 60 AU"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1998

  - claim_id: "pioneer-claim-ruled-out-causes"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Potential causes ruled out include: gravity from Kuiper belt, gravity from galaxy, spacecraft gas leaks, errors in planetary ephemeris, errors in Earth orientation/precession/nutation, solar radiation pressure, and precessional attitude-control maneuvers"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1998

  - claim_id: "pioneer-claim-not-universal"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "If the anomalous acceleration is gravitational in origin, it is not universal - it must affect bodies in the 1000 kg range more than planetary-sized bodies by a factor of 100 or more, which would violate the Principle of Equivalence"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1998

  - claim_id: "pioneer-claim-ulysses-confirmation"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Ulysses spacecraft was subjected to an unmodelled acceleration towards the Sun of (12 ± 3) × 10^-8 cm/s², consistent with the Pioneer effect"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1998

prediction:
  - prediction_id: "pioneer-prediction-future-tests"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "Future tests using Pioneer 10 reacquisition, further Ulysses data, Pluto Express mission, and Solar Probe mission could provide high-quality data to investigate the anomaly"
    prediction_year: 1998
    status: "partially_verified"
    verification_method: "Further analysis was conducted, and the anomaly was largely resolved in 2012 through detailed thermal radiation analysis"

  - prediction_id: "pioneer-prediction-new-physics"
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    statement: "The origin of the anomalous signal might be new physics, though the probability is that some standard physics or unknown systematic will be found to explain it"
    prediction_year: 1998
    status: "falsified"
    verification_year: 2012
    verification_method: "The anomaly was largely explained by anisotropic thermal radiation from spacecraft systems, not new physics"
