  - theory_id: "differential-geometry"
    name: "Differential Geometry"
    year: 1827
    summary: "Mathematical field that studies geometric structures using techniques from calculus and linear algebra. Studies curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds, their curvature, and intrinsic properties. Founded by Gauss's work on surfaces and developed by Riemann into the study of n-dimensional manifolds. Provides the mathematical foundation for general relativity and modern physics."
