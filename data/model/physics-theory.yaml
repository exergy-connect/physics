    brief: "A physics theory or concept"
    description: |
      Represents a physics theory, concept, or model. Theories can be hierarchical
      (parent-child relationships) and contain assumptions, postulates, claims, papers,
      and associated people. Theories are organized by category (e.g., Classical Mechanics,
      Quantum Physics, Relativity) and have a year of development.

  - name: assumption
    brief: "An assumption underlying a theory"
    description: |
      Represents an assumption or premise that underlies a physics theory. Assumptions
      are background conditions, implicit premises, or contextual constraints that are
      taken as given. They may be simplifying conditions (e.g., "no friction", "isolated
      system") or structural premises (e.g., "spacetime is a 4D manifold"). Unlike postulates,
      assumptions are often implicit or contextual rather than explicitly stated as
      foundational principles. They provide the framework within which the theory operates.

  - name: postulate
    brief: "A fundamental postulate of a theory"
    description: |
      Represents a fundamental postulate or axiom of a physics theory. Postulates are
      explicitly stated foundational principles that are taken as true without proof and
      from which other results are derived. They are the core building blocks of the theory,
      often called "laws" or "principles" (e.g., "Equivalence Principle", "Einstein Field
      Equations"). Unlike assumptions, postulates are explicitly stated as the fundamental
      axioms of the theory and are typically the primary principles from which claims and
      predictions follow.

  - name: claim
    brief: "A claim or consequence of a theory"
    description: |
      Represents a claim or consequence derived from a physics theory. Claims are
      theoretical statements or consequences that follow from the theory's assumptions
      and postulates. Unlike predictions, claims may be more general theoretical
      consequences that are not necessarily testable in isolation.

  - name: prediction
    brief: "A testable prediction made by a theory"
    description: |
      Represents a specific, testable prediction made by a physics theory. Predictions
      are concrete, falsifiable statements that can be experimentally verified or
      falsified. They are distinct from claims in that they are explicitly testable
      and have both a prediction year (when the prediction was made) and potentially
      a verification year (when it was tested). Predictions are the bridge between
      theory and experiment.
