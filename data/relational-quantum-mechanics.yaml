theory:
  - theory_id: "relational-quantum-mechanics"
    name: "Relational Quantum Mechanics"
    year: 1996
    summary: "Interpretation of quantum mechanics that states quantum states are relative to observers, not absolute. Proposes that there is no absolute state of a system, only states relative to other systems. Resolves the measurement problem by eliminating the need for wave function collapse."

    assumptions:
      - assumption_id: "rqm-assumption-1"
        statement: "Quantum states are relative to observers, not absolute"
        rationale: "There is no absolute state of a system; states only exist relative to other systems (observers)"
      - assumption_id: "rqm-assumption-2"
        statement: "All systems are equivalent as observers"
        rationale: "Any physical system can serve as an observer; there is no fundamental distinction between observer and observed"
      - assumption_id: "rqm-hypothesis-1-all-systems-equivalent"
        statement: "All systems are equivalent: nothing distinguishes a priori macroscopic systems from quantum systems. If the observer O can give a quantum description of the system S, then it is also legitimate for an observer P to give a quantum description of the system formed by the observer O."
        rationale: "This hypothesis rejects any fundamental distinction between system/observer, quantum/classical system, or physical system/consciousness. It allows any physical system to serve as an observer."
      - assumption_id: "rqm-hypothesis-2-completeness"
        statement: "Quantum mechanics provides a complete and self-consistent scheme of description of the physical world, appropriate to our present level of experimental observations."
        rationale: "This hypothesis asserts that quantum mechanics is complete and does not require hidden variables or additional underlying theories."
    postulates:
      - postulate_id: "rqm-postulate-1-limited-information"
        statement: "There is a maximum amount of relevant information that can be extracted from a system."
        formulation_year: 1996
      - postulate_id: "rqm-postulate-2-unlimited-information"
        statement: "It is always possible to acquire new information about a system."
        formulation_year: 1996
      - postulate_id: "rqm-postulate-3-superposition"
        statement: "If c and b define two complete families of questions, then the unitary matrix U_cb in p(Q^(i)_c, Q^(j)_b) = |U^(ij)_cb|² can be chosen in such a way that for every c, b and d, we have U_cd = U_cb U_bd and the effect of composite questions is given by eq.(17)."

    claims:
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-1"
        statement: "Relational Quantum Mechanics resolves the measurement problem without requiring wave function collapse"
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-2-observer-dependence"
        statement: "In quantum mechanics, different observers may give different accounts of the same sequence of events. Quantum mechanical descriptions are relative to a particular observer."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-3-information-theory"
        statement: "Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world. Physics is the theory of the relative information that systems have about each other."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-4-no-absolute-state"
        statement: "The notion of observer-independent state of a system, or observer-independent values of physical quantities, is inadequate to describe the physical world beyond the ħ → 0 limit. There is no absolute state of a system, only states relative to other systems."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-5-planck-constant"
        statement: "Postulate 1 (limited information) already adds Planck's constant to classical physics. Planck's constant can be viewed as the transformation coefficient between physical units (position × momentum) and information-theoretical units (bits)."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-6-formalism-reconstruction"
        statement: "The full formalism of quantum mechanics can be (almost) reconstructed from Postulates 1 and 2. The physical content of the general formalism of quantum mechanics is (almost) nothing but a sequence of consequences of two physical facts expressed in postulates 1 and 2."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-7-relational-values"
        statement: "In quantum mechanics, 'state' as well as 'value of a variable' or 'outcome of a measurement' are relational notions in the same sense in which velocity is relational in classical mechanics. All physical variables are relational."
        status: "theoretical"
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-8-measurement-problem"
        statement: "The measurement problem (the unease with quantum mechanics) derives from the use of an incorrect notion: the notion of observer-independent state of a system, or observer-independent values of physical quantities. By abandoning such a notion, quantum mechanics makes much more sense."
        status: "theoretical"
