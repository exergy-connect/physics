All entities were created with correct required fields, maintaining consistency and minimal representation. The paper is linked to the existing Pioneer anomaly documented in the database.",

Turyshev), 3 assumptions (Pioneer precision, all forces accounted, thermal isotropy), 5 claims (anomalous acceleration confirmed, constant magnitude, ruled-out causes, non-universality, Ulysses confirmation), and 2 predictions (future tests, new physics possibility).
