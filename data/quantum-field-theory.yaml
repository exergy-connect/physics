        name: "Path Integral Formulation"
        year: 1948
        summary: "Alternative formulation of quantum mechanics that describes the probability amplitude for a particle to travel between two points as a sum over all possible paths. Each path contributes with a phase proportional to the action along that path. Equivalent to the Schrödinger equation but provides intuitive insights into quantum behavior."
